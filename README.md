# Blackjack

This is a coding exercise to create a blackjack scorer.  Nothing too crazy to see here.  Just test-driving things and having fun.

Code still needs some clean-up, but it works.

Had a fight or two with Git, so there are likely some extra useless commits in here that you can ignore if you really cared.
